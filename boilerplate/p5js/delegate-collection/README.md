# p5.js generative art collection

This folder contains boilerplate code for creating `p5.js` generative art collections

## Usage

1. Update and inscribe `delegate.html` with your generative art code
2. Create individual art pieces by making delegate inscriptions to your inscribed `delegate.html` ([Example batch.yml](batch.yml))

## Batch Inscribing

Use [inscribe.dev/batch](https://inscribe.dev/batch) to easily create multiple delegate inscriptions with parent child provenance.

## Example

Check out [Spellbound](https://ordinals.com/inscription/451accbce30177c23a8cd42ab85131312a449359ada3c054aa147b054136fa3bi0) for an example of a generative art collection using this technique.
